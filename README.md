## Description
This database allows the users to view all departments, roles, and employees. The user also has the option to add a department, role, or employee. The user can also update an employee's role or manager. One flaw with this application is that there is a glitch when inquirer is asking the user to add a new role. The question will be asked twice, but also this data is inserted into the tables twice.
